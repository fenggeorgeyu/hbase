/**
 * A memstore-local allocation buffer.
 * <p>
 * The MemStoreLAB is basically a bump-the-pointer allocator that allocates big (2MB) chunks from
 * and then doles it out to threads that request slices into the array. These chunks can get pooled
 * as well. See {@link MemStoreChunkPool}.
 * <p>
 * The purpose of this is to combat heap fragmentation in the regionserver. By ensuring that all
 * Cells in a given memstore refer only to large chunks of contiguous memory, we ensure that
 * large blocks get freed up when the memstore is flushed.
 * <p>
 * Without the MSLAB, the byte array allocated during insertion end up interleaved throughout the
 * heap, and the old generation gets progressively more fragmented until a stop-the-world compacting
 * collection occurs.
 * <p>
 * This manages the large sized chunks. When Cells are to be added to Memstore, MemStoreLAB's
 * {@link #copyCellInto(Cell)} gets called. This allocates enough size in the chunk to hold this
 * cell's data and copies into this area and then recreate a Cell over this copied data.
 * <p>
 * @see MemStoreChunkPool
